# korg-prologue
Presets and custom oscillators and effects for the [prologue synthesizer](https://www.korg.com/products/synthesizers/prologue).

In order to build these projects you have to get the prologue [SDK](https://github.com/korginc/logue-sdk) and copy any of the project directories to some new directory in logue-sdk/platform/prologue/; for example copy [src/pluck/](src/pluck) to logue-sdk/platform/prologue/len/pluck/ and then you can build with make.

If you don't want to write code and compile, just download the prebuilt binaries from the [builds/](builds/) directory.
