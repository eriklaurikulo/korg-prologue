# korg-prologue
Presets and custom oscillators and effects for KORG Prologue.

In order to build these projects you have to get the KORG Prologue SDK and make a symlink logue-sdk/platform/prologue/len to the src/ directory. Or copy any of the projects directories to some new directory in logue-sdk/platform/prologue/, for example copy src/organ to logue-sdk/platform/prologue/len/organ.

If you don't want to write code and compile, just download the prebuilt binaries from the builds/ directory.
