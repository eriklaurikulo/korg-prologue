# korg-prologue
Presets and custom oscillators and effects for KORG Prologue.

In order to build these projects you have to get the KORG Prologue SDK and copy any of the project directories to some new directory in logue-sdk/platform/prologue/, for example copy src/pluck/ to logue-sdk/platform/prologue/len/pluck/

If you don't want to write code and compile, just download the prebuilt binaries from the builds/ directory.
