In order to build these projects you have to get the KORG Prologue SDK and copy these directories to some directory new directory in logue-sdk/platform/prologue/ (for example, copy organ/ to logue-sdk/platform/prologue/len/organ/).

If you don't want to modify the code, just download the prebuilt binaries in ../builds/.
