This is a auto pan (stereo tremolo) modulation effect for KORG Prologue.

The speed knob controls the frequency of the tremolo from 1 hz to 10 hz. At 12 o'clock the frequency is 5.5 hz, just like the classic Wurlitzer stereo tremolo.
The depth knob controls the depth of the effect, from totally dry to totally wet.

There's a prebuilt binary in ../../builds/
