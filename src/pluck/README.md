This is a user oscillator for KORG Prologue implementing the Karplus-Strong plucked string algorithm.

The shape knob controls the damping factor of the low-pass filter applied in the feedback of the delay line, and shift-shape controls the attenuation (the minimum is almost no attenuation and the notes will have a lot of sustain, max is a lot of attenuation and the notes will be very short). Experiment with it. Sounds great layered over the analog oscillators.

There's a prebuilt binary in ../../builds/
