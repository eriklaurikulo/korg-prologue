This is a tremolo modulation effect for KORG Prologue.

The speed knob controls the frequency of modulation from 1 hz to 10 hz. At 12 o'clock the frequency is 5.5 hz, just like the classic Wurlitzer tremolo.
The depth knob goes from totally dry to totally wet.

There's a prebuilt binary in ../../builds/
