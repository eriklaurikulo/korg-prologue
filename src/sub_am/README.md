This is a modulation effect for KORG Prologue that does amplitude modulation using the sub timbre as modulator and the main timbre as carrier.

The speed knob scales the modulation signal (the sub timbre), and the depth knob changes the mix from completely dry to completely wet.

There's a prebuilt binary in ../../builds/
