This is a user oscillator for KORG Prologue implementing organ-like additive synthesis.

There are 5 drawbars available in the user oscillator parameters (edit -> 7). The drawbars function just like the five upper manual drawbars in a Vox Super Continental.

The shape knob produces a sort of detuning effect, and shift-shape adds overdrive. For the time being all waveforms are sine waves.

There's a prebuilt binary [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/len/korg-prologue/master/builds/organ.prlgunit)
